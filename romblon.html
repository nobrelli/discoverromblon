					<p>If you have ever had traveled to Mindoro, Marinduque, or Palawan, you might also be interested to travel in Romblon. 
					It is one of the beautiful provinces of the MIMAROPA region of the Philippines you will have ever been at. On a map's scale, 
					you'll see that Romblon is just a small group of islands, yet it offers travelers a lot of Instagramable scenic geography. 
					You just have to travel 360 around its three major and four minor islands so as for you to get the idea on how you will get the most of your trip.</p>

					<p>Romblon brings back pieces of memories from the history, although it hasn't quite been at the height of its fame since it 
					is secluded from the larger islands of the Philippine archipelago, and some tourists have not yet reached the very peak of its 
					beauty ever since they had visited the place. Due to the isolation, the untouched and pristine blue beaches blessed this place; 
					therefore, Romblon has been a traveler's paradise and a place for people who feel lost and look for a home.</p>

					<h1>The Romblon’s Vistas</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog-details">
					<p>Traveling around Romblon is a new stunning adventure wherever you go around. It has countless features to offer, 
					despite being just a small landmass. Every inch screams the word "beautiful," from the extraordinary beaches to the 
					breathtaking falls and the people who live in it. One notable example of these is an extraordinary place called 
					Bonbon Beach located in Barangay Lonos. Bonbon is popularly known for its long stretch of pristine white sand beach 
					and a sandbar that connects it to Bang-og Island during low tide. It is privately owned, and you will not see any 
					artificial structures around. However, only a few tourists visit this place unlike Boracay, Palawan, etc.; therefore, 
					you have the freedom to enjoy the picturesque and magnificent view of this place during off seasons. This beach is 
					perfect for people who were already fed up with the aura of some overcrowded beaches. You'll just have to take that 
					#PerfectSelfie with the view.</p>
					
					<p>If they're from tip to toe jaded of other people's presence and just want to look for a more relaxing, more serene 
					and more secluded place, there's an islet on Sibuyan Island called Cresta De Gallo. It is an island surrounded by pristine 
					blue water and is one of the most beautiful places you could ever find in Romblon. Getting there has never been as easy 
					as you’re gonna have to traverse rough and rocky roads while taking a crack at withstanding the roasting heat of the sun. 
					Once you have arrived on the islet, it’s all definitely worth the hike, and it would be a great challenge for you to 
					start off! You'll be in awe of how beautiful this place has always been.</p>
					
					<p>They are not just the beautiful pristine blue beaches that you'll see in Romblon. This place is also home for numerous 
					majestic waterfalls. Each has their own distinct features. To name a few, Dulom Falls, also known as the "Dark Falls," 
					as only few sunlight pass through; the Mablaran Falls, an epic and most popular waterfalls in San Andres; and  Garing Falls in Odiongan, 
					Romblon, which is a two-layered falls with a pool below, which is perfect for swimming and diving.</p>

					Marble Shopping Center at Brgy. Poclacion, Romblon, Romblon. After all, it is the Marble Capital of The Philippines. 
					You can buy great quality marble souvenirs in different sizes at a very affordable price. There's also a rare and expensive 
					type of marble, the Romblon black marble (Black Onyx), which is perfect for some collectors. Also, the century-old marbles 
					are handcrafted by the talented people of Romblon.</p>

					when you visit or plan to visit the place.</p>
					
					<p>"It's more fun in the Philippines," has always been a mantra of most local and foreign travelers when they visit the 
					country, but specifically it's more fun in Romblon as it offers more relaxing and more exquisite view of nature from
